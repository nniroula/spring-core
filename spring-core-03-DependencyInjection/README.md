##### Three types of Dependency Injection in Spring framework
1. Field Based Dependency Injection
-- user ``@Autowired`` on variables
<br>
<br>

2. Setters Based Dependency Injection
-- use ``@Autowired`` with setters
<br>
<br>

3. Constructor Based Dependency Injection
-- use ``@Autowired`` on constructor - but it is not mandatory. Constructor based dependency injection works without the usage of @Autowired.


Needed concepts: <br>
-- a. @Configuration <br>
-- b. @Component <br>
-- c. @ComponentScan <br>
-- d. Java Configuration file <br>
